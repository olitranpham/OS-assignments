- Check the slide “Numbers Everyone Should Know” in Jeff Dean’s talk back in 2009 https://www.cs.cornell.edu/projects/ladis2009/talks/dean-keynote-ladis2009.pdf 
- Do some research and see if the following numbers have been improved or not nowadays?
  - L1 cache reference
  - Branch mispredict
  - L2 cache reference
  - Mutex lock/unlock
  - Main memory reference
  - Read 1 MB sequentially from memory
  - Round trip within same datacenter
  - Disk seek
  - Read 1 MB sequentially from disk
  - Send packet CA->Netherlands->CA

  1. 2009: L1 cache reference = 0.5 ns
     Recent (2024): 1-4 cycles (~1 ns)

  2. 2009: Branch mispredict = 5 ns
     Recent (2025): 15-20 ns in the Intel 4th-generation Haswell (and other Lake-generation CPUs). There was still an increase in branch mispredicts from a CPU that 
                    was released in 2013.

  5. 2009: Main memory reference = 100 ns
     Recent (2021): ~60-100 ns on a Kaby Lake i7-7660U CPU running at 2.5GHz

  7. 2009: Round trip within same datacenter = 500,000 ns
     Recent-ish (2017): 370,000 ns from us-west1-a (Oregon) to us-west1-a (Oregon)

  8. 2009: Disk seek = 10,000,000 ns / 10 ms
     Recent: 4-9 ms

  9. 2009: Read 1 MB sequentially from disk = 20,000,000 ns / 20 ms
     Recent (2025): 290 Seq MB/s = 3.45 ms for Toshiba N300 Pro 12TB

  10. 2009: Send packet CA->Netherlands->CA = 150 ms
      Recent (right now): 138.409  from Los Angeles to Amsterdam. Amsterdam to Los Angeles is 138.493 ms.
